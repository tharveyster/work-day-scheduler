# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project is a work day event scheduler. It was created using `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, and `Moment.js`.

The application determines the current day of the week and date, and displays them under the title.

It also uses the current time to determine the background colors for each hour. Hours that have passed are displayed with a gray background, the current hour has a pink background, and future hours have a green background.

When you select a row, type in an event, and press the save button, the event is saved to local storage, and will remain visible even after a refresh.
